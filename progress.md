# RAG Capstone — Project Handbook

> This file is three things at once:
> 1. **A progress tracker** — what's done, what's active, what's sealed.
> 2. **An assignment handbook** — each station has tasks and *questions you answer yourself*. No answers are written here on purpose.
> 3. **A context handoff** — enough for a Cursor agent (or future-you) to pick up without re-explaining the project.
>
> Built end-to-end with **no orchestration frameworks** (no LangChain / LlamaIndex). Every component is explicit and defensible in an interview.

## How to use this handbook

- Work **top to bottom**. Do not open 🔒 sealed phases early — they're sealed so new terminology arrives only when you're ready for it.
- At each station: do the **Tasks**, then write your own answers to the **Questions** in the *Notes & answers* space. Fill the matching row in the **Design decisions log**.
- A station is done only when its **Definition of done** is met. Then advance.
- Use **Cursor** for implementation help and **this chat** for mentoring, quizzing, and unlocking the next phase. When a phase completes, the chat regenerates this README with the next phase expanded.

## For AI coding agents (Cursor) — read this first

**Project:** A local, scrappy, end-to-end RAG system over a judgment-&-decision-making corpus, with a quantitative evaluation harness. The human (Tom) is building this as a portfolio piece to defend in forward-deployed / solutions / applied-AI interviews.

**Hard rules — do not violate:**
1. **No high-level RAG frameworks.** No LangChain, no LlamaIndex, no framework that hides retrieval/chunking/orchestration. Thin libraries only (sentence-transformers, numpy, anthropic, psycopg, rank-bm25, typer).
2. **Low abstraction.** Prefer explicit, readable code the human can explain line-by-line over clever indirection.
3. **This is a learning project.** For the *precious* components below, **do not hand over finished solutions.** Review the human's code, point out bugs, ask leading questions, explain tradeoffs — but let them write it. You may write *plumbing* freely.
4. **Never answer the handbook Questions for the human.** If asked, coach toward the answer; don't state it.

**Precious (human implements, you coach):** `ingest/chunker.py`, `retrieve/dense.py`, `generate/client.py` (retry/backoff), `eval/metrics.py`.
**Plumbing (you may write freely):** `ingest/loader.py`, `embed/embedder.py`, `generate/prompt.py`, `scripts/`.

**Stack (locked):** Python 3.11 · `uv` · `ruff` (line length 100; rules E,F,I,UP,B) · `pytest` (`pythonpath=src`). Embeddings `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (local, cached, normalized). Retrieval: brute-force cosine (Week 1) → Postgres + pgvector + full-text search (Week 2). Generator: Claude Haiku 4.5. Judge: Claude Sonnet 4.6. Config lives in `src/rag/config.py`. One commit per component.

**Current state:** see the Progress tracker below. The active task is whatever is marked 📍.

## Project overview

**Goal:** ingest a corpus → chunk → embed → store → hybrid retrieve (dense + keyword) → answer with an LLM → expose a CLI/UI, with a held-out eval set and documented system-design tradeoffs.

**Learning objectives:** (1) implement and reason about each RAG component; (2) make and justify system-design tradeoffs; (3) design a quantitative evaluation; (4) produce a clean repo + README defensible in an FDE/solutions interview.

**Corpus:** ~30–50 Wikipedia articles on judgment & decision-making / cognitive biases. Chosen because the domain is familiar (fast, trustworthy gold Q/A) and full of *confusable* concepts that stress retrieval — good for error analysis and for motivating the hybrid upgrade.

# Phase 1 — Week 1: minimal end-to-end slice  *(CURRENT PHASE)*

Goal of the week: a working `ingest → embed → retrieve → answer` pipeline on the corpus, dense-only, with a basic eval. Hybrid retrieval, the full eval harness, and the UI are deliberately **not** in this phase.

### Station 0 — Scaffold + tooling  ✅ done

**Reflection (write 2–3 sentences):**
- The repo splits modules into "precious" (you implement) and "plumbing" (provided). Which is which, and why might that boundary matter for what you can credibly claim in an interview?

---

### Station 1 — Token chunker  📍 YOU ARE HERE

**Objective:** turn raw documents into overlapping fixed-size token chunks.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `chunk_document` in `src/rag/ingest/chunker.py`.
2. Make all five tests in `tests/test_chunker.py` pass (`make test`).
3. Fill the *Chunking* row of the Design decisions log.

**Questions to answer (no peeking — these are interview bait):**
1. Why chunk at all instead of embedding each article whole? There are two distinct reasons — one is a hard constraint, one is about retrieval quality. Name both.
2. `chunk_size` is set to 256 even though the embedder's window is 512. Why might going deliberately *smaller* than the max be the better choice — and what breaks if you go too small?
3. What concrete failure does `overlap=0` cause on this corpus? And what goes wrong if overlap is *too* large (e.g. 200 of 256)?
4. You chunk using the embedding model's own tokenizer. What silently goes wrong if you instead chunk by character count or word count?

**Definition of done:** tests green · all four questions answered in Notes · Design-log row filled · committed as `feat: token chunker`.

### Station 2 — Embedding

**Objective:** turn chunks into vectors, cached to disk.

**Tasks:**
1. Read `src/rag/embed/embedder.py` (provided). Run `make index` once the chunker works — confirm vectors land in `.cache/`.
2. Fill the *Embedding model* row of the Design decisions log.

**Questions to answer:**
1. What does a dense embedding give you that keyword matching cannot? And what can keyword matching do that embeddings are bad at? (Hold onto the second half — it's the whole reason hybrid retrieval exists.)
2. Why `bge-small-en-v1.5` rather than a larger open model or a hosted API like `text-embedding-3-large`? List the axes of that tradeoff.
3. The embedder L2-normalizes vectors. What does that let you simplify at search time, and why?
4. The code prepends an instruction to *queries* but not *passages*. Why the asymmetry?

**Definition of done:** index builds · questions answered · log row filled · committed.

### Station 3 — Dense retrieval (brute force)

**Objective:** given a query vector, return the top-k chunks.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `DenseIndex.search` in `src/rag/retrieve/dense.py`.
2. Sanity-check: ask 3–4 questions you know the answer to; do the right chunks surface?

**Questions to answer:**
1. What is cosine similarity measuring geometrically, and why is it the right choice for these (normalized) vectors?
2. Brute-force search is O(?) in the number of chunks. At what corpus size does that stop being acceptable, and what *family* of algorithm/structure replaces it? (You don't need to implement it — just name it and the tradeoff it makes.)
3. `top_k` is a knob. What goes wrong if it's too small? Too large? How does its best value interact with your chunk size?

**Definition of done:** retrieval returns sensible chunks · questions answered · committed.

**Notes & answers:**
```

```

### Station 4 — Generation + rate limiting

**Objective:** pass retrieved context to Claude Haiku 4.5 and return a grounded answer, with robust retries. *(Confirm the current Anthropic SDK call + error types with the chat before implementing — don't let it go stale.)*

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `generate` in `src/rag/generate/client.py`: build the prompt (provided builder), call the API, retry on transient failures.
2. Run `make ask` end-to-end.
3. Fill the *Generator* row of the Design decisions log.

**Questions to answer:**
1. Which API failures are worth *retrying* and which should fail fast? Why retry some and not others?
2. Why exponential backoff *with jitter*, rather than a fixed delay or plain exponential? What specifically does jitter prevent?
3. What's the failure mode if you don't cap the number of retries?
4. Estimate your cost-per-query: take your typical input tokens (system + context + question) and output tokens, and compute the Haiku cost. Write the number and the assumptions. (This becomes a README section.)

**Definition of done:** end-to-end answer works · retries handle a forced failure · questions answered · log row filled · committed.

**Notes & answers:**
```

```

### Station 5 — Basic evaluation

**Objective:** measure retrieval quality on a small gold set.

**Tasks:**
1. Author ~12–15 gold Q/A pairs over the corpus → `data/qa/gold.jsonl` (scales to ~25 in Week 2).
2. Implement `hit_rate_at_k` and `mrr_at_k` in `src/rag/eval/metrics.py`.
3. Run them over your gold set; record the numbers.

**Questions to answer:**
1. What's the difference between evaluating *retrieval* and evaluating *answer quality*? Why measure them separately rather than just grading final answers?
2. Define hit-rate@k and MRR in your own words. What does each one *fail* to capture?
3. How will you decide a retrieved chunk counts as "relevant" for a given gold question? What are the failure modes of that labeling rule?

**Definition of done:** gold set exists · metrics implemented and run · numbers recorded · questions answered · committed. **→ Week 1 complete; ask the chat to unlock Phase 2.**

# Phase 2 — Week 2: hybrid retrieval + storage + eval harness  🔒 SEALED

Unlocks when Week 1 is complete. Preview only: move off brute-force into a real store, add keyword retrieval and fuse it with dense, and build the full evaluation harness (incl. LLM-as-judge). Detailed tasks and questions appear when you reach it.

# Phase 3 — Week 3: polish, cost/latency, UI  🔒 SEALED

Unlocks after Week 2. Preview only: small UI, measured latency and cost-per-query, finalized README + error analysis.
